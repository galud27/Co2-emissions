# Co2-emissions
This tutorial was implemented from an eviromental python class  to show you  how to get data from Scripps Institute of Oceanography's website http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2/ to look at the  CO2 emmisions in Hawaii. In this project we will read the data, make a date time index  and plot Keeling curves.
